<img src="https://suc.neocities.org/art.jpg" alt="Mogul Original Art" style="zoom: 12%;" />

## Mogul is a show about hip hop’s most iconic moments, told by the people who lived them. Hosted by Brandon Jenkins. 

In Season 3, we’re telling the story of DJ Screw, a reclusive genius who changed the sound of music forever. An auteur who created his own genre — Chopped and Screwed — Screw slowed music down until it sounded like syrup coming out of your speakers. It quickly became the soundtrack to the city of Houston, before influencing an entire generation of rappers. But the man behind the beats was a mystery to all but his closest collaborators, and to this day remains one of hip-hop’s greatest enigmas.
